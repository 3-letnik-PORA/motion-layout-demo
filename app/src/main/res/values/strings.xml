        <h4>PROGRAMMING IS EVERYWHERE</h4>
        <p>Programming is, quite literally, all around us. From the take-out we order, to the movies we stream, code enables everyday actions in our lives. Tech companies are no longer recognizable as just software companies — instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi, influence outcomes in presidential elections, or act as a personal trainer.</p>

        <h4>AND PROGRAMMING IS FOR EVERYONE</h4>
        <p>For many years, only a few people have known how to code. However, that’s starting to change. The number of people learning to code is increasing year by year, with estimates around 31.1 million software developers worldwide, which doesn’t even account for the many OTHER careers that relate to programming.</p>
        <p>Here at Codecademy, our mission is to make technical knowledge accessible and applicable. Technology plays a crucial role in our economy — but programming is no longer just for software engineers. Any person can benefit from learning to program — whether it’s learning HTML to improve your marketing emails or taking a SQL course to add a dose of analysis to your research role.</p>
        <p>Even outside of the tech industry, learning to program is essential to participating in the world around you: it affects the products you buy, the legal policies you vote for, and the data you share online.</p>
        <p>So, let’s dig into what programming is.</p>
